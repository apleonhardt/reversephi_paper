### Abstract

Optical illusions provide powerful tools for mapping the algorithms and
circuits that underlie visual processing, revealing structure through atypical
function. Of particular note in the study of motion detection has been the
reverse-phi illusion. When contrast reversals accompany discrete movement,
detected direction tends to invert. This occurs across a wide range of
organisms, spanning humans and invertebrates. Here, we map an algorithmic
account of the phenomenon onto neural circuitry in the fruit fly *Drosophila
melanogaster*. Through targeted silencing experiments in tethered walking flies
as well as electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we demonstrate that ON- or
OFF-selective local motion detector cells T4 and T5 are sensitive to certain
interactions between ON and OFF. A biologically plausible detector model
accounts for subtle features of this particular form of illusory motion
reversal, like the re-inversion of turning responses occurring at extreme
stimulus velocities. In light of comparable circuit architecture in the
mammalian retina, we suggest that similar mechanisms may apply even to human
psychophysics.
